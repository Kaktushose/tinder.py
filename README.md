# Tinder.py

Big shoutout to [@fbessez](https://github.com/fbessez/Tinder) and [@rtt](https://gist.github.com/rtt/10403467#file-tinder-api-documentation-md) and their work back in 2018 and 2014. They have done most of the reverse engineering and without them this project would not have been possible.

**Note: This is an unofficial project and I have nothing to do with Tinder nor their API. I take no responsibility for any potential damage, banned accounts or other troubles related to this project** 

## Release

This is a very early stage of the project, thus there is no release available yet.
